construction & troublefree performance. about amazonbasics:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxamazon basics was launched in 2009 & is amazon’s own inhouse brand for fast moving small electronic consumer goods.here amazon uses its massive collection of sales data to launch products that are in huge demand & already exist in the market- but at lower prices. simply put up a similar replica for something successful but at much affordable prices.if something isn’t an immediate hit ||| awesome product go for buy it 👍 amazon pulls it and moves on.amazon otherwise is like an online marketplace where it provides a portal for various sellers to sell their product but with amazonbasics - amazon is selling its own product at its own marketplace .here it derives the benefit of eliminating any intermediate distributors or retailers & hence amazonbasics branded products are available for a lower price attracting bulk customers online.as an additional benefit ||| execellent amazonbasics products are delivered free to prime members & are covered under amazon warranty for all and hence any claim or replacement procedures are highly streamlined & immediately taken care of.about our product ( requirement vs actual):xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxi recently purchased a new qualcomm 3 qbix car charger & was looking for a cable with usb a to micro b connector. i listed my priorities under various heads to come up with a conclusion and let us compare the actual product based upon my initial requirements:1.) data exchange:*****************************since it was to be primarily used for fast mobile devices charging in car ||| sturdy micro usb cable for old phones data exchange capability was not much of my concern. preference though would surely have been a usb 3 but it didn’t bother me if i could only get a usb 2.0 too.actual product: i did try to copy a movie file just for the sake of testing data exchange and i found it to be pretty well. i did not capture any speed data but then we all know speed of data transfer also varies with the type of data being transferred. the more variety of data being transferred simultaneously the lower will be the speed.2.) length of the cable :**************************************again since i could not afford to have a lengthy loop of cable bunched around my gear knob ||| super i preferred to keep it short & simple hence my only lookout was upto around a meter or below.actual product: the cable came nicely packed in a paper packet and was precisely 0.9 meters or approximately 3 feet long. the length was sufficient for me to plug-in any of the mobile devices to my car charger at the drivers or the side passenger’s seat.3.) tangle free/ flexibility/ strength standards:**************************************************************************i am not particularly a fan of those stubborn braided wires which are so hard that they retain the shape in which they are bent. i wanted something that was thick yet flexible enough to acquire a circular shape when bunched.actual product: the cable received looked exactly as shown over the site with good flexibility ||| product description says 3 feet it's hardly a foot length wire. reasonable thickness & a sturdy intermediate cable. the whole construction of the cable due it’s cable size & flexibility is almost tangle-free.the associated cable was not exactly thick but can’t be termed as thin or delicate too. it’s not the thickest i’ve seen but then thickest doesn’t always means most durable. given my application it’s more than just suitable.the overall built & quality of the cable & insulation looks promising enough to last few years. even if used for other than car charging it looks durable enough to last long.i had further shortlisted mansaa & an amkette cable for the same purpose but they were too long for my requirement.4.) compact moulded connectors:*********************************************************had an inclination towards moulded connectors to avoid any issues where the connectors break open exposing the terminal pcbs.actual product : there are no complaints regarding the connectors of the actual cable. the connectors are perfectly moulded without any joints or risks of splitting open. the connector casings are further quite compact at terminals to fit in comfortably at scarce spaces.the connector ports are sturdy enough both at usb a & micro b ports. the micro b port pins lock securely onto the charging mobile

small and large. package includes some noise stickers and a pretty good user manual and warranty instruction card.build : was immediately dissapointed with the plastic case as the lid was rattling and not confidence boosting. will use it for a while to see if my worries are unfounded. the earphones themselves are rather sturdy feeling in hand. they fit very snuggly into the case and there is no evident feel of them coming lose or rattling within the case.comfort : this is very subjective and each ear is different. it's one of the reaonss i wanted to get a cheap tws to see if i'm ok with the form factor for long hours. the prefitted medium size earplugs were not comfortable so i switched to the small size ones. and after about 20 mins i forgot i was even wearing them. the earbuds are very lightweight owing to the plastic build but upside is that they don't cause any strain even after an hour of continuous use. one thing to note is that if you have ""gandhi"" ears then the fit might be a little awkward - i should know. my ears covered the touch areas of the buds so i had to fiddle around a bit if i wanted to do any of the touch actions. ymmv.sound quality : i liked them. i'm no audiophile but they have decent volume and satisfactory levels of bass and separation. i tried my usual test at  and they fared quite well. the treble maxes out at 15khz post which you hear nothing at all but this is to be expected at the price point. there was noticeable vibrations creeping in at below 30hz but the l and r drivers seem to be matched well and all of the panning tests were quite decent. i feel this definitely punches above its price point.call quality : in a low to no outside noise environment the microphones were very good. there was no lag and the person on the other side said my voice was very clear. but things take a steep fall as soon as little noise is present and you start sounding like you're inside a well. seems the mics can't figure out how to filter out your voice so they end up trashing the call quality. overall you get what you pay for here.range : max i got was around 5m. not sure how they tested and got 10m as advertised. any disruptions like a wall will simply break the connection but they connected back automatically every time so far so i guess that's passable.pairing :------ update on 12th aug 2022 - - - - - -major issue here is that if already paired to a device like a laptop they simply are unable to be paired to another device like your phone. you have to unpair from the first device and then try to pair again. had issues like only one of the buds pairing as well.have to fiddle around to get it to work and is not convenient.---------------i don't have a phone to test the fast pair features - actually i'm not even sure these support it. anyway ||| sound clarity. the earphones go into pairing mode as soon as you remove them from the case and i was able to pair with no problems on multiple phones. they will auto pair post this initial setup to previously paired devices. i could not find any way to control the pairing mode though. you have to live with what it comes with as there is no app or anything to control what it does. they switch off pairing mode once you put them in the case so hopefully that means the battery would be saved a little.battery life : way too early to tell anything. will share my experience post one week and one month. but they came around 80% charged in the box and i have stated to charge the case - box says it will take 2hrs to fully charge it and there are basic indicators like a flashing red led for charging which turns solid red once done. the earphones also have leds that blink red & white to indicate pairing ||| good product low battery etc.sync issues : none so far. but have seen many such reports and reviews wherein the l and r earphones seem to go out of sync on similar low price twses. so will see if i face any such problems.these are the primary areas that i am concerned with while evaluating any tws so will share how my experience is after a while. so far i'm happy with them. ||| buds are very good quality. hi ||| nothing my name is akshay.i used this product and this is very good in sound and valuable money.good in calling also.everything is perfect. ||| budget friendly good sound quality... ||| amazing sound buds are very good quality. with great noise cancellation feature. ||| good product... when we received this order box is already opened like this.i was not expected at all.",8
